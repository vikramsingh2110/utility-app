## Technologies Used

- **React**: For building the user interface.
- **TypeScript**: For static typing and improved code quality.
- **Framer Motion**: For animations and smooth transitions.
- **EmailJS**: For handling email form submissions.
- **Tailwind CSS**: For styling.

## Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/vikramsingh2110/utility-app.git
    ```


2. **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. **Start the development server:**

    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

4. **Visit `http://localhost:3000` in your browser.**

## Configuration

- **EmailJS Integration**: Update the `ContactForm` component with your EmailJS service ID, template ID, and user ID.

## Assumptions and Decisions

- **TypeScript Usage**: Chose TypeScript to enhance code reliability and maintainability.
- **UI Consistency**: Maintained design consistency by using provided CSS files.
- **EmailJS**: Selected for its ease of integration and handling of form submissions.

## Implementation Process

1. **Initial Setup**: Set up the project with Vite, React, and Tailwind CSS.
2. **Component Development**:
   - **Header**: Developed a responsive navigation bar with smooth animations.
   - **HeroSection**: Implemented dynamic background images and text with Framer Motion.
   - **MainContent**: Created a content section with interactive elements and animations.
   - **ContactForm**: Integrated EmailJS and added form submission feedback.
   - **Footer**: Designed with animated entrance and background image overlay.
3. **TypeScript Conversion**: Converted components to TypeScript for static typing and improved code quality.

## Challenges

- **TypeScript Conversion**: Ensuring type safety across all components while maintaining functionality.
- **Animation Consistency**: Ensuring smooth and consistent animations across different devices and states.

## Suggested Upcoming Features

- **Enhanced Form Validation**: Implement more robust validation and error handling for the contact form.
- **Dark Mode**: Add a toggle for dark mode to improve user experience.
- **CMS Integration**: Incorporate a CMS for dynamic content updates without code changes.

## Additional Remarks

The application is designed for flexibility and scalability. Future improvements can focus on adding new features and optimizing performance. Contributions and feedback are encouraged.
